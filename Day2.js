    //Activity 4: Logical Operators
        //Task 11: WAP that uses && opearator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.

        console.log(!((2>3)||(3>2)));
    
    //Activity 5: Ternary Operator
        //Task 14: WAP that useu the ternary operator to check if a  number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
